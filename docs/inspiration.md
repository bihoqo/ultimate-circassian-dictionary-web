# Grammar Blog Ideas

The idea is that there would be a blog with articles. Those articles would explore various espects of Circassian, eastern and western. There would also be different kind of articles. Below is a brainstorming list.

- Grammar Articles:

  - Those articles would dive into a certain grammar topic. This could be broad or very specific.

- Grammar Book:
  The idea here is that one would take the the various articles (I think mostly grammar articles), and one creates a certain hierarchical structure. This is more a "view" into the unstructured grammar articles.

- Phrasebook Topics:

  - The idea here is that a "phrasebook" article would handle an overarching topic. For example, "Getting to know each other", "Pharmacy", "New Year", etc. These kind of articles would have a list of relevant vocabulary, phrases and dialogue.

- Vocabulary (single word or phrase):

  - A more concentrate "phrasebook" article. Here one would talk about something interesting in regards to one word or phrase.

- Song text

  - In this one could explore songs from a grammatical point of view.

- Story
  - Here one could write stories and analyze them grammatically. Something along the lines what is done with the song texts.

## Components

- IPA tooltip for east and west Circassian
- Grammar table
- Example box
